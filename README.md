# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Predictor using ANN and Streamlit

This project is a web-based application that predicts whether a customer is likely to **churn** (leave a service) based on historical customer data. The prediction is powered by an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and the interface is built using **Streamlit**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ§  Predict customer churn using an ANN trained on real-world data
- ðŸ’¡ User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- ðŸ“Š Accepts customer details as input and returns a churn prediction
- ðŸ’¾ Includes pre-trained model and encoders for easy deployment
